SNHU CS Capstone ePortfolio 

Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the computer science program has changed the way I think about problem solving. When I first began, I saw computer science as a series of technical steps that led to working code. Over time, I realized it is more about how to think logically, structure information, and build something that not only functions but makes sense. Each course built on the last, shaping a way of thinking that is both analytical and creative. Developing the ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to look back on that process and recognize how each project contributed to my understanding of design, structure, and precision in technology.

Throughout the program I worked independently on every project, which taught me discipline and self-direction. Each assignment required me to plan my own approach, manage time carefully, and evaluate the quality of my work without relying on group feedback. This independence strengthened my ability to troubleshoot, research solutions, and document my reasoning clearly. I also learned how to communicate technical information effectively through written explanations and organized project reports. Writing about my work became a way to test my own understanding and to translate technical ideas into language that others could follow.

The coursework gave me practical experience with data structures, algorithms, software engineering, database design, and security. I learned how to use algorithms to create efficient systems and how data structures can simplify complex problems. My Raspberry Pi thermostat project brought these skills together. It required me to think about system architecture, algorithmic logic, and data management all at once. I designed it to collect and analyze temperature data, control LEDs and display output, and log results into a database. Building that project taught me how to make software interact reliably with hardware while maintaining stability and readability in the code.

The three artifacts in my ePortfolio reflect the main areas of growth in my learning. The software design work focuses on structure and clarity. The algorithms section demonstrates reasoning, logic, and performance improvement. The database enhancement shows how data can be organized, stored, and used efficiently. Together these artifacts show a complete picture of how I approach computing problems and how my skills have developed throughout the program.

Looking back, I can see how this program shaped my goals and how it prepared me for a career that values both precision and adaptability. I have learned to approach problems patiently and methodically and to balance practical function with thoughtful design. Whether I move further into IT or pursue work in software development, I now have the confidence and skill set to create systems that are reliable, understandable, and purposeful. The ePortfolio is more than a collection of projects. It is a reflection of the mindset I have built as a computer scientist and the professional I will become.
