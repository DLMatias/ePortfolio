  <h3>CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio</h3>

  <p>
    Welcome to my ePortfolio for the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University.
    This portfolio documents the development of my Raspberry Pi thermostat project through multiple milestones,
    showing how it evolved from a simple embedded system into a fully structured, data-driven application.
    Each version demonstrates growth in software design, algorithmic reasoning, and database management.

    <h3>Artifacts: Raspberry Pi Thermostat Project</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="Thermostat - Original.py">Original Thermostat Project (CS 350)</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The initial version created for CS 350 demonstrated basic functionality: reading temperature data,
        controlling LEDs, and displaying output on a 16x2 LCD screen. It provided the foundation for later enhancements
        and was used to test circuit wiring and device communication.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="ThermostatV2.py">Version 2 – Software Design & Engineering</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This version focused on code structure, maintainability, and system reliability. It added organized
        error handling, grouped configuration variables, and safe resource management to prevent I/O conflicts and runtime failures.
        These changes aligned with the software design and engineering category, improving the overall quality and readability
        of the program.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="ThermostatV3.py">Version 3 – Algorithms & Data Structures</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This milestone introduced algorithmic enhancements that improved performance and stability.
        A moving average filter was added to smooth sensor readings, a hysteresis function reduced LED flicker, and
        a scheduling algorithm allowed automatic setpoint changes based on time of day. These changes demonstrated
        effective use of algorithmic principles to optimize real-world behavior.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="ThermostatV4.py">Version 4 – Database Integration</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The final enhancement implemented SQLite database functionality for persistent data storage.
        This allowed the thermostat to log temperature readings and user events safely and efficiently. The database
        structure included tables for readings and events, showing how local data management can improve monitoring
        and long-term analysis of system performance.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Narratives and Reflections</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="CS 499 Milestone Two Narrative.docx">Milestone Two – Software Design and Engineering Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This reflection discusses the process of improving the original code’s structure and reliability.
        It focuses on secure coding practices, maintainability, and error management, explaining how Version 2 met the
        learning outcomes related to design and engineering.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="CS 499 Milestone Three Narrative.docx">Milestone Three – Algorithms and Data Structures Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This reflection describes the integration of algorithmic logic, such as moving averages, hysteresis,
        and scheduling. It explores how these updates improved performance and introduced efficient decision-making
        processes in a real-time embedded system.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="CS 499 Milestone Four Narrative.docx">Milestone Four – Database Integration Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This reflection explains the addition of the SQLite database and how data persistence expanded
        the system’s capabilities. It emphasizes the importance of structured data handling, safe commit procedures,
        and long-term usability in embedded systems.</span>
