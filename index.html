    <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>

    <p>
      Completing the computer science program has changed the way I think about problem solving. When I first began, I saw computer science as a series of technical steps that led to working code. Over time, I realized it is more about how to think logically, structure information, and build something that not only functions but makes sense. Each course built on the last, shaping a way of thinking that is both analytical and creative. Developing the ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to look back on that process and recognize how each project contributed to my understanding of design, structure, and precision in technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the program I worked independently on every project, which taught me discipline and self-direction. Each assignment required me to plan my own approach, manage time carefully, and evaluate the quality of my work without relying on group feedback. This independence strengthened my ability to troubleshoot, research solutions, and document my reasoning clearly. I also learned how to communicate technical information effectively through written explanations and organized project reports. Writing about my work became a way to test my own understanding and to translate technical ideas into language that others could follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The coursework gave me practical experience with data structures, algorithms, software engineering, database design, and security. I learned how to use algorithms to create efficient systems and how data structures can simplify complex problems. My Raspberry Pi thermostat project brought these skills together. It required me to think about system architecture, algorithmic logic, and data management all at once. I designed it to collect and analyze temperature data, control LEDs and display output, and log results into a database. Building that project taught me how to make software interact reliably with hardware while maintaining stability and readability in the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      The three artifacts in my ePortfolio reflect the main areas of growth in my learning. The software design work focuses on structure and clarity. The algorithms section demonstrates reasoning, logic, and performance improvement. The database enhancement shows how data can be organized, stored, and used efficiently. Together these artifacts show a complete picture of how I approach computing problems and how my skills have developed throughout the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, I can see how this program shaped my goals and how it prepared me for a career that values both precision and adaptability. I have learned to approach problems patiently and methodically and to balance practical function with thoughtful design. Whether I move further into IT or pursue work in software development, I now have the confidence and skill set to create systems that are reliable, understandable, and purposeful. The ePortfolio is more than a collection of projects. It is a reflection of the mindset I have built as a computer scientist and the professional I will become.

    <h3>Artifacts: Raspberry Pi Thermostat Project</h3>

    <p>
      The thermostat project began as a simple hardware prototype and gradually evolved into a complete embedded computing system. Each version expanded the design both conceptually and technically, adding new logic, structure, and capabilities. This section shows the development from a foundational Python script into a fully engineered application that incorporates algorithms, modular design, and database integration.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/Thermostat%20-%20Original.py">Original Thermostat Project (CS 350)</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The first version was created for CS 350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. It established the basic functionality of the thermostat: reading temperature data from an AHT20 sensor, displaying the output on a 16x2 LCD, and controlling red and blue LEDs to represent heating and cooling. The code directly handled all sensor, LED, and display operations in one file without modular structure. While functional, it lacked separation of concerns and relied heavily on sequential logic, which made future expansion difficult.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV2.py">Version 2 – Software Design & Engineering</a><br>
        <span class="desc">Version 2 focused on improving software organization and maintainability. The code was restructured into distinct classes, including a <code>ManagedDisplay</code> class for LCD control and a <code>TemperatureMachine</code> class that implemented a clear state machine. Threads were introduced to handle asynchronous display updates, and locks were used to prevent resource conflicts on the I²C bus. This milestone aligned with the software design and engineering outcome by turning a procedural prototype into a modular, object-oriented program that follows clear state-driven design principles.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV3.py">Version 3 – Algorithms & Data Structures</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The third version added algorithmic reasoning and efficiency improvements. Sensor readings were processed through a moving average algorithm to smooth noise and improve stability. A hysteresis system was added to reduce LED flicker by creating a temperature buffer between on and off states. The program logic was updated to handle time-based events and manage scheduled temperature adjustments. These changes introduced computational efficiency, better real-world responsiveness, and more intelligent control logic, demonstrating an understanding of how algorithmic design improves performance and user experience.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV4.py">Version 4 – Database Integration</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The final version integrated a local SQLite database to enable data persistence. Each temperature reading and thermostat event was logged automatically with timestamps, allowing for long-term analysis of temperature trends and user adjustments. The database logic was implemented in a separate <code>ThermostatDatabase</code> class that manages connections, writes, and safe commits. This addition showed how embedded systems can leverage databases for efficient data management, bridging hardware control with long-term digital storage and analysis.</span>

It also reflects on how these changes supported secure and stable system operation by reducing direct hardware conflicts and enforcing clearer logic boundaries.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="Narratives/CS%20499%20Milestone%20Three%20Narrative.docx">Milestone Three – Algorithms and Data Structures Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This narrative focuses on how algorithmic thinking transformed the thermostat’s behavior. It explains the reasoning behind adding moving averages to stabilize readings, hysteresis logic to prevent frequent LED toggling, and scheduling algorithms for adaptive control. It also details how these updates improved performance and reliability, linking them to theoretical foundations in data processing and algorithmic optimization learned earlier in the program.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="Narratives/CS%20499%20Milestone%20Four%20Narrative.docx">Milestone Four – Database Integration Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This final reflection explores the integration of persistent data storage using SQLite. It discusses designing the schema for temperature and event logging, implementing efficient database writes, and handling potential concurrency issues. The narrative connects these technical updates to broader database design principles such as normalization, indexing, and transaction safety, emphasizing how structured data management completes the system’s full lifecycle of sensing, processing, and storage.</span>

    <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      While the thermostat operates locally, design choices such as input validation, I²C lock control, and exception handling 
      were added to improve reliability and prevent system failure. These features reflect a security mindset that anticipates 
      and mitigates risks such as sensor errors, data corruption, and device miscommunication, ensuring system integrity even in 
      unexpected conditions.
