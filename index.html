    <h3>CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio</h3>
  </header>

  <p>
    Welcome to my ePortfolio for the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University.
    This portfolio documents the development of my Raspberry Pi thermostat project through multiple milestones,
    showing how it evolved from a simple embedded system into a fully structured, data-driven application.
    Each version demonstrates growth in software design, algorithmic reasoning, and database management.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio was created to communicate my work clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
    Each artifact and narrative includes documentation that explains the design decisions and logic behind
    each improvement, demonstrating my ability to collaborate through clear and accessible technical communication.

    <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
    <p>
      Completing the computer science program has changed the way I think about problem solving. When I first began, I saw computer science as a series of technical steps that led to working code. Over time, I realized it is more about how to think logically, structure information, and build something that not only functions but makes sense. Each course built on the last, shaping a way of thinking that is both analytical and creative. Developing the ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to look back on that process and recognize how each project contributed to my understanding of design, structure, and precision in technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the program I worked independently on every project, which taught me discipline and self-direction. Each assignment required me to plan my own approach, manage time carefully, and evaluate the quality of my work without relying on group feedback. This independence strengthened my ability to troubleshoot, research solutions, and document my reasoning clearly. I also learned how to communicate technical information effectively through written explanations and organized project reports. Writing about my work became a way to test my own understanding and to translate technical ideas into language that others could follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The coursework gave me practical experience with data structures, algorithms, software engineering, database design, and security. I learned how to use algorithms to create efficient systems and how data structures can simplify complex problems. My Raspberry Pi thermostat project brought these skills together. It required me to think about system architecture, algorithmic logic, and data management all at once. I designed it to collect and analyze temperature data, control LEDs and display output, and log results into a database. Building that project taught me how to make software interact reliably with hardware while maintaining stability and readability in the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      The three artifacts in my ePortfolio reflect the main areas of growth in my learning. The software design work focuses on structure and clarity. The algorithms section demonstrates reasoning, logic, and performance improvement. The database enhancement shows how data can be organized, stored, and used efficiently. Together these artifacts show a complete picture of how I approach computing problems and how my skills have developed throughout the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, I can see how this program shaped my goals and how it prepared me for a career that values both precision and adaptability. I have learned to approach problems patiently and methodically and to balance practical function with thoughtful design. Whether I move further into IT or pursue work in software development, I now have the confidence and skill set to create systems that are reliable, understandable, and purposeful. The ePortfolio is more than a collection of projects. It is a reflection of the mindset I have built as a computer scientist and the professional I have become.

    <h3>Artifacts: Raspberry Pi Thermostat Project</h3>

    <p>
      The thermostat project was developed to automate temperature control using sensor data. Each version refines how
      the system processes input, updates output, and stores data. Together, these enhancements demonstrate my ability
      to apply algorithmic and software-engineering principles to create an efficient, reliable, and well-structured solution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/Thermostat%20-%20Original.py">Original Thermostat Project (CS 350)</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The initial version created for CS 350 demonstrated basic functionality: reading temperature data,
        controlling LEDs, and displaying output on a 16x2 LCD screen. It provided the foundation for later enhancements
        and was used to test circuit wiring and device communication.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV2.py">Version 2 – Software Design & Engineering</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This version focused on code structure, maintainability, and system reliability. It added organized
        error handling, grouped configuration variables, and safe resource management to prevent I/O conflicts and runtime failures.
        These changes aligned with the software design and engineering category, improving the overall quality and readability
        of the program.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV3.py">Version 3 – Algorithms & Data Structures</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This milestone introduced algorithmic enhancements that improved performance and stability.
        A moving average filter was added to smooth sensor readings, a hysteresis function reduced LED flicker, and
        a scheduling algorithm allowed automatic setpoint changes based on time of day. These changes demonstrated
        effective use of algorithmic principles to optimize real-world behavior.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV4.py">Version 4 – Database Integration</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The final enhancement implemented SQLite database functionality for persistent data storage.
        This allowed the thermostat to log temperature readings and user events safely and efficiently. The database
        structure included tables for readings and events, showing how local data management can improve monitoring
        and long-term analysis of system performance.</span>

        and scheduling. It explores how these updates improved performance and introduced efficient decision-making
        processes in a real-time embedded system.</span>

      <li>
        <a href="Narratives/CS%20499%20Milestone%20Four%20Narrative.docx">Milestone Four – Database Integration Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This reflection explains the addition of the SQLite database and how data persistence expanded
        the system’s capabilities. It emphasizes the importance of structured data handling, safe commit procedures,
        and long-term usability in embedded systems.</span>

    <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      While the thermostat operates locally, design choices such as input validation, I²C lock control, and exception handling 
      were added to improve reliability and prevent system failure. These features reflect a security mindset that anticipates 
      and mitigates risks such as sensor errors, data corruption, and device miscommunication, ensuring system integrity even in 
      unexpected conditions.
