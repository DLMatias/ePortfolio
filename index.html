    <h3>CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio</h3>
  </header>

  <p>
    Welcome to my ePortfolio for the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University.
    This portfolio documents the development of my Raspberry Pi thermostat project through multiple milestones,
    showing how it evolved from a simple embedded system into a fully structured, data-driven application.
    Each version demonstrates growth in software design, algorithmic reasoning, and database management.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio was created to communicate my work clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
    Each artifact and narrative includes documentation that explains the design decisions and logic behind
    each improvement, demonstrating my ability to collaborate through clear and accessible technical communication.

    <h3>Artifacts: Raspberry Pi Thermostat Project</h3>

    <p>
      The thermostat project was developed to automate temperature control using sensor data. Each version refines how
      the system processes input, updates output, and stores data. Together, these enhancements demonstrate my ability
      to apply algorithmic and software-engineering principles to create an efficient, reliable, and well-structured solution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/Thermostat%20-%20Original.py">Original Thermostat Project (CS 350)</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The initial version created for CS 350 demonstrated basic functionality: reading temperature data,
        controlling LEDs, and displaying output on a 16x2 LCD screen. It provided the foundation for later enhancements
        and was used to test circuit wiring and device communication.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV2.py">Version 2 – Software Design & Engineering</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This version focused on code structure, maintainability, and system reliability. It added organized
        error handling, grouped configuration variables, and safe resource management to prevent I/O conflicts and runtime failures.
        These changes aligned with the software design and engineering category, improving the overall quality and readability
        of the program.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV3.py">Version 3 – Algorithms & Data Structures</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This milestone introduced algorithmic enhancements that improved performance and stability.
        A moving average filter was added to smooth sensor readings, a hysteresis function reduced LED flicker, and
        a scheduling algorithm allowed automatic setpoint changes based on time of day. These changes demonstrated
        effective use of algorithmic principles to optimize real-world behavior.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="artifacts/ThermostatV4.py">Version 4 – Database Integration</a><br>
        <span class="desc">The final enhancement implemented SQLite database functionality for persistent data storage.
        This allowed the thermostat to log temperature readings and user events safely and efficiently. The database
        structure included tables for readings and events, showing how local data management can improve monitoring
        and long-term analysis of system performance.</span>

    <h3>Narratives and Reflections</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="Narratives/CS%20499%20Milestone%20Two%20Narrative.docx">Milestone Two – Software Design and Engineering Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This reflection discusses the process of improving the original code’s structure and reliability.
        It focuses on secure coding practices, maintainability, and error management, explaining how Version 2 met the
        learning outcomes related to design and engineering.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="Narratives/CS%20499%20Milestone%20Three%20Narrative.docx">Milestone Three – Algorithms and Data Structures Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This reflection describes the integration of algorithmic logic, such as moving averages, hysteresis,
        and scheduling. It explores how these updates improved performance and introduced efficient decision-making
        processes in a real-time embedded system.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="Narratives/CS%20499%20Milestone%20Four%20Narrative.docx">Milestone Four – Database Integration Narrative</a><br>
        <span class="desc">This reflection explains the addition of the SQLite database and how data persistence expanded
        the system’s capabilities. It emphasizes the importance of structured data handling, safe commit procedures,
        and long-term usability in embedded systems.</span>

    <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      While the thermostat operates locally, design choices such as input validation, I²C lock control, and exception handling 
      were added to improve reliability and prevent system failure. These features reflect a security mindset that anticipates 
      and mitigates risks such as sensor errors, data corruption, and device miscommunication, ensuring system integrity even in 
      unexpected conditions.

    <h3>Industry and Technical Relevance</h3>
    <p>
      This project integrates multiple technologies commonly used in modern computing, including Python threading, I²C communication, 
      and SQLite database management. These elements demonstrate my ability to design practical and adaptable computing solutions 
      using industry-standard tools and practices. The project reflects the type of development found in IoT, automation, and embedded systems work.
